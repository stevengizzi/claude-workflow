# Schema: Structured Review Verdict

**Referenced by:** DEC-281
**Used by:** Runner (parsing), Tier 2.5 triage (input if CONCERNS)
**Produced by:** Review skill (`.claude/skills/review.md`)

---

## Overview

The structured review verdict is a JSON block appended to the end of the
standard human-readable review report. It provides a machine-parseable review
outcome for the autonomous runner. The human-readable report is always produced
first and remains the primary artifact for human review.

## Extraction

The JSON block is fenced with a labeled code fence:

````
```json:structured-verdict
{ ... }
```
````

The runner extracts via regex: `` ```json:structured-verdict\n(.*?)\n``` ``
(dotall mode). If the block is absent, the review is classified as INCOMPLETE
and the session is retried.

## Verdict Decision Rules (for Runner)

The runner acts on the verdict as follows:

| Verdict | Runner Action |
|---------|--------------|
| CLEAR, no HIGH/CRITICAL findings | Proceed to next session |
| CLEAR, but has HIGH findings | Flag as WARNING, proceed (findings logged) |
| CONCERNS | Invoke Tier 2.5 triage to classify findings |
| ESCALATE | Halt immediately, notify HALTED, await human resolution |

Additional automatic escalation (regardless of stated verdict):
- `files_not_modified_check.passed == false` → treat as ESCALATE
- `regression_checklist.all_passed == false` → treat as ESCALATE
- `spec_conformance.status == "MAJOR_DEVIATION"` → treat as ESCALATE

## Mode Behavior

- **Autonomous mode:** Runner extracts and acts on this block automatically.
- **Human-in-the-loop mode:** Block is produced for record-keeping. Developer
  reads the human-readable report and makes their own judgment.
